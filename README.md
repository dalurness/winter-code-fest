# Winter Code Fest 
Welcome to the coolest coding festival of the year!

## Introduction 
The Winter Code Fest was created as a way to encourage taking some time to try something new! The questions are meant to be easy and medium difficulty so that **they don't take up too much time** (this is supposed to be a fun exercise, not a chore!). 

Instead, we encourage you to **branch out** and **be creative** while solving the puzzles. Maybe use a programming language you are not familiar with, or try to solve the questions in a unique way. 

Some feats to date: 
- the first several questions solved in excel
- one question solved completely in machine code

## Once You Have Finished A Question
Once you have completed a question, submit your answer with a PR to this repo! The solutions belong in `/src/content/communitySolutions`.**Set the name of the file to your GitHub username**. Include descriptions (look at an example of someone else's submission) along with your code and then we will merge it to start showing on the site.


## Contributing 
We would love your help on this project! Whether you want to add a question, put a little more flair to the site styles, or modify a question to come to a more checkable solution, we appreciate the help. Head over to the [contributing file](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
