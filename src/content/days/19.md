title: "There Has Bin A Problem With The Naughty And Nice List"
---

Santa just reached out and it turns out that an issue has come up with the naughty and nice list. He realized that he forgot the list at his summer home while working on it, so he asked the caretakers there to just send over the file (Yes it's digital. Do you have any idea how much paper that would take, not to mention how difficult it would be to change/audit/search through!?)

However, the caretakers are not very tech savvy, and somehow they managed to send it over in a very strange format!

**Problem**: Santa has handed over **_[a sample](./bin.txt)_** of it to us and wants a solution to fix the problem by the end of the day. Please return a code solution that can convert the stragely formatted list to one that is readable! Then we can use that to convert the whole list.
