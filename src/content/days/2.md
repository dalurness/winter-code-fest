To help keep things efficient at the North Pole, Santa uses a text intercom system to pass messages. But right now that system is bugging out! It isn't correctly decoding messages!

**Problem**: Create a decoder for the following encoding scheme:

- Alphabetical characters are encoded as a 2 digit number with a prepended "**\\**"
- **a - z** are encoded as **00 - 25**
- **A - Z** are encoded as **26 - 51**
- A "**\\**" is escaped with "**\\\\**"
- Any other characters are left as is (the system Santa uses was made by elves, they hate latin characters so they encoded them)

There are two files: [*"small_message_encoded.txt"*](./small_message_encoded.txt), which you can test on, and [*"large_message_encoded.txt"*](./large_message_encoded.txt), which you should also decode and then share if you can hear "it" to prove you completed the challenge.

**Example**:  
Input:
```
\33\04\11\11\14, \48\14\17\11\03!
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
```
