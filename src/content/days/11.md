For the numbers 1 - 1,000,000:
- If the number is divisible by 6, append ` Merry Christmas` to it
- If the number contains any `8`s, then replace each `8` with a `HO`
- Otherwise just include the number

The result of each number is then concatenated.

**Problem**: How many digits are there in the number produced when summing the numbers produced when splitting the result string by non-digit characters?
