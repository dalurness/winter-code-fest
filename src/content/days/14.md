title: "Let Out Your Excited SQL!"

---
On Christmas Eve, Santa travels far and wide! But what if something happens to him? What if he has a heart attack from eating too many cookies and needs a double bypass? Instead of changing his ways and eating healthier, he would rather risk death and the tears of many children who without him would be presentless. Mrs. Claus, however tempted by the life insurance policy as she may be, can't stand the thought of presentless kids and makes the effort to prepare for the worst.

For this challenge, first obtain a program capable of decompressing ZSTD files like ***[7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)***, and decompress the ***[data.sqlite.zst](./data.sqlite.zst)*** file. This is a ***[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)*** database of hospitals and service costs in Utah.

**Problem**: From the file, find out the following information for Mrs. Claus:

- How many hospitals are there in Utah? (easy)
- What percentage of services can be paid in cash? (Santa doesn't believe in taxes, so all cash it is) (medium)
- On average, for any "bypass" procedure offered by a hospital, what is the difference in cost between paying cash and just getting a negotiated rate through insurance like Mrs. Claus keeps asking him to get? (hard)
