You think Santa does all his work in one night! NO NO NO! The real magic of Santa is logistics! He and his elves work hard throughout the year to make Christmas Eve go flawlessly. Part of his work is storing caches of presents throughout the world! That makes things easier on him and his reindeer. He is looking to take a stash to his cache in Saskatoon, CA and he'd like to know when would be the best and worst times to visit since the weather can be fairly nasty. 

For this challenge, use the weather quality CSV to find:
- When are the best 7 consecutive days to visit?
    - This is done by getting the average per day by county, then averaging that for a summary of all of Saskatchawan
- How bad are the worst 7 days?
